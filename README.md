Generate the git command you need using ChatGPT

## How it works

You describe the actions you want to do, and GPT-3 will give you the git commands

Stack:
- React
- NextJS
- OpenAI GPT-3 API (text-davinci-003)
- Vercel

Inspired by the awesome repo [Twitterbio.com](https://github.com/Nutlope/twitterbio)

## Running Locally

Put your API key from OpenAI in the `.env` file.
And run:

```bash
# Install the dependencies

```
